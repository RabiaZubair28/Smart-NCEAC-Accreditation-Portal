  {
    question: 'what is nceac',
    answer: "NCEAC (National Computing Education Accreditation Council) is Pakistan's premier accreditation body for computing education programs."
  },
  {
    question: 'how does the accreditation process work',
    answer: "It includes SAR submission, evaluation visit, review, and then a decision by the NCEAC council."
  },
  {
    question: 'what is a clo',
    answer: "CLOs are Course Learning Outcomes. They describe what a student should know or be able to do after completing a course."
  },
  {
    question: 'what is a plo',
    answer: "PLOs are Program Learning Outcomes. They describe what a student should achieve by the end of the degree program."
  },
  {
    question: 'how are clos and plos connected',
    answer: "CLOs are mapped to PLOs to track how each course contributes to overall program outcomes."
  },
  {
    question: 'how is faculty evaluated',
    answer: "Faculty are evaluated on qualifications, teaching effectiveness, research output, and student feedback."
  },
  {
    question: 'what are the infrastructure requirements',
    answer: "Institutions need modern labs, classrooms, libraries, internet, and learning management systems."
  },
  {
    question: 'how are students assessed',
    answer: "Through assignments, quizzes, presentations, exams, and projects — all mapped to CLOs and PLOs."
  },
  {
    question: 'how does the system handle clo to plo mapping',
    answer: "The system maps assessment marks to their corresponding Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs). Each CLO is then linked to one or more Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs) using a predefined weighted mapping. When a student's assessment marks exceed the threshold set by the instructor, the associated PLOs are marked as achieved. This approach ensures that PLO achievement is directly influenced by the student's performance in CLO-linked assessments."
  },
  {
    question: 'who is responsible for setting the threshold for plo mapping',
    answer: "The threshold for PLO mapping is set by the instructor teaching the respective course. They determine the performance benchmark students must meet for CLOs and associated PLOs to be considered achieved."
  },
  {
    question: 'what are the maximum and minimum limits for the threshold in plo mapping',
    answer: "There is no fixed maximum or minimum threshold. The threshold is entirely defined by the instructor and can vary based on the course content and the difficulty level of assessments. This flexibility allows instructors to tailor the criteria according to their academic objectives."
  },
  {
    question: 'how can i view my plo achievement status',
    answer: "Navigate to your student dashboard and open the 'PLO Performance' section. You will find a summary of your PLO achievements across different courses."
  },
  {
    question: 'can i know which questions contributed to a specific clo',
    answer: "Yes, in the assessment report, each question is tagged with the CLO it contributes to. This helps in understanding how each CLO was evaluated."
  },
  {
    question: 'who creates batches',
    answer: "Only the Head of Department (HOD) has the authority to create new batches in the system."
  },
  {
    question: 'what features does an instructor have',
    answer: "Instructors can update their profile information, add or remove their research publications, create assessments for their assigned courses, allocate marks to students, and define performance thresholds for CLO-PLO mapping."
  },
  {
    question: 'what features does the hod have',
    answer: "The Head of Department (HOD) can manage their profile and research publications, create and manage student batches, edit accreditation-related details, enroll or unenroll students, and assign or change student sections as needed."
  },
  {
    question: 'how many clos are there',
    answer: "The number of Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) varies depending on the course. Each course will have a defined set of CLOs."
  },
  {
    question: 'what are assessments',

  },
  {
    question: 'can elective courses be counted for plo mapping',
    answer: "Yes, elective courses can and should be mapped to Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs) if they contribute to the attainment of those outcomes."
  },
  {
    question: 'what details must be included in a course schema for accreditation',
    answer: "A course schema for accreditation typically includes: course title, course code, credit hours, prerequisites, course description, CLOs, topics covered, teaching methodology, assessment methods, textbook(s) and references, and the CLO-PLO mapping."
  },
  {
    question: 'how are clos mapped to plos for accreditation',

  },
  {
    question: 'what prevents total clo weights from exceeding 100%',
    answer: "The system should have validation rules in place when defining assessment components linked to CLOs to ensure that the total weight assigned to CLOs in any assessment does not exceed 100%."
  },
  {
    question: 'how does the system handle duplicate clo mappings in assessments',
    answer: "The system should ideally prevent or flag duplicate CLO mappings within the same assessment to ensure accurate measurement of individual CLO attainment."

  },
  {
    question: 'how does the system detect accreditation breaches',
    answer: "Accreditation breaches related to classroom warnings might not be automatically detected by the system unless there are specific modules for tracking such issues. This often relies on manual reporting and audits."
  },
  {
    question: 'where to update faculty status',
    answer: "There should be a faculty management section in the system where administrative users can update the employment status of faculty members."
  },
  {
